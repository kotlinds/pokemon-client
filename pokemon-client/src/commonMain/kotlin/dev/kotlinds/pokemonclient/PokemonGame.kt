/**
 * A Pokémon game we know how to "see" through RAM and play through the console port.
 *
 * Part of the `pokemon-client` library (dev.kotlinds.pokemonclient): a common interface to read Pokémon
 * games (position, dialogue, team, battle...) and drive them, with one implementation per game.
 *
 * The AI doesn't look at the screen: it reads text/JSON. Each supported game therefore provides a reader turning raw
 * RAM into the common typed [GameState] (the same model for every game; the views turn it into what agents read).
 * Supporting another game (SoulSilver, Platinum, Emerald...) means implementing this interface.
