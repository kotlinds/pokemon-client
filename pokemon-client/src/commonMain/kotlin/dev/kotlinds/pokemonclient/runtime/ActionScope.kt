/**
 * The primitives an action uses to play: advance frames, press buttons, touch the screen, read the RAM.
 *
 * An action owns the console while it runs (the app gives it an exclusive "lease"): every frame it asks
 * for is emulated right away, and nothing else happens in between. So an action sees each frame and can
 * react on the exact frame something appears (a fishing bite, a cursor that moved).
 *
 * Pressing is done with [tap], which checks itself against what the game actually read (see [InputProbe]):
 * the button is held until the game has seen it, then released until the game no longer sees it. That is
 * one press, never long enough to trigger the game's key auto-repeat (the "double move" bug of holding a
 * D-pad direction until the screen changes).
 *
 * @param port the console, used from the current (console) thread only.
 * @param inputProbe reads which buttons the game has registered, from its RAM (per game).
 * @param interruption checked before every frame: returns why the action must stop now (the human took the
 *   controller, the user pressed stop...), or null to go on.
 * @param onFrame called after every emulated frame (the app paces frames for display and plays audio there).
 * @param onProgress told how far a long action has got ([report]), e.g. the tiles of a long `go_to`.
