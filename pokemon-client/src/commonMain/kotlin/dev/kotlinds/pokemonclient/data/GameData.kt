/**
 * The static data of a Pokémon game (the Pokédex-like knowledge: species, moves, items, type chart, TMs), read from
 * the game's own ROM.
 *
 * Ids are the source of truth: every lookup takes a typed id and every record carries typed values (enums for
 * types, categories, pockets). Names are display only: they come from the ROM's text, so they are in the ROM's
 * language (a French ROM gives French names) and must never be matched against to decide anything.
 *
 * Lookups return null for ids the game doesn't define. Implementations decode lazily and cache.
