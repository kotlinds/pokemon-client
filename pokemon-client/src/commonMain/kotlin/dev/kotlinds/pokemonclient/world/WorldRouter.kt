/**
 * Routes across zones: floors of a dungeon, buildings and the outdoor area, linked by warps and holes
 * ([WorldLinks]). One Dijkstra over (area, [Node]) pairs: inside an area the moves are the [Pathfinder]'s; stepping
 * onto a warp (or pressing its direction on an exit mat) or onto a hole jumps to the arrival tile of the other zone.
 *
 * The live state is only known for the player's zone ([overlayFor] gives the people, refused steps and active
 * triggers there); other zones use the static maps with their obstacle objects where the map places them
 * ([staticOverlay]: boulders and rocks are back in place whenever the player enters a map). The walker follows the first link of the route, then plans again
 * from where it really arrived, so the static guess for the other zones is corrected on the way.
