/**
 * People and coordinate triggers of the current map that block a way, with why and how to get past.
 *
 * Everything comes from the RAM (the zone's live map objects and its loaded coordinate events, see
 * [HgssReader]): an object of the zone whose event flag is set isn't spawned, so every live object is one whose
 * event isn't done yet.
 * - **Curated** ([curated]): the well-known story blockers, from the decomp scripts, with our walkthrough reason.
 *   A curated person blocks while it is on the map and its [Curated.liftedWhen] doesn't hold yet (some never
 *   leave: they step aside once the condition holds); a curated trigger blocks while its var condition holds.
 * - **Generic**: any other trigger whose var condition holds now (stepping on it starts a story scene; skipped when
 *   a map has more than [MAX_GENERIC_TRIGGERS] of them: gym pits, hideout traps), and any other person that will
 *   leave after a story event (non-zero event flag, not a trainer) standing in a one-tile passage of the terrain.
 *
 * Targets are `person:<event id>` (the object's local id, as in [dev.kotlinds.pokemonclient.state.FieldObject.id])
 * and `trigger:<index>` (index in the zone's coordinate events).
