 * Aqua → 8 Kanto badges → Red at Mt. Silver). Where the game leaves a choice (the Kanto gyms, the middle of Johto), the
 * steps say which ones must come first ([HgssStoryStep.after]): the open goals ([openGoals]) are every step not done
 * whose earlier steps are; the goal ([goal]) is the first of them in the table's order.
 *
 * Every condition comes from the decomp (pret/pokeheartgold): include/constants/flags.h, vars.h and the scripts that
 * set them, files/fielddata/script/scr_seq/scr_seq_<n>_<map>.s (cited per constant). Rules followed:
 * - a flag is only used when no script clears it again (several "hide" flags are reset by the Hall of Fame);
 * - a var is compared with >= only when it only grows along the story;
 * - a step that the game lets the player skip or do later is written so that a later milestone also counts as done
 *   (an [Or] with the next badge), so a skipped optional event never hides the real next step.
 * SoulSilver differences (Tidal Bell, Lugia) are not covered: the Clear Bell / Ho-Oh steps are HeartGold's.
