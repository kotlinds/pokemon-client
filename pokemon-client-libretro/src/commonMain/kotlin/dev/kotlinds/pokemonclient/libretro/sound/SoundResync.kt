/**
 * Music during pauses, the resync: when a paused game resumes, gives it the sound playback state of the shadow
 * console that kept playing the music meanwhile, so the music goes on instead of jumping back to where the pause
 * started.
 *
 * The main console stays frozen during the pause. A second instance of the core (the shadow) loads the paused state
 * and runs it with no input, and its sound is played. At resume, the shadow stops at a safe frame
 * ([SoundDriverState.isSafeFrame]), and its sequencer state (ARM7 WRAM ranges of [SoundDriverLayout]) and sound
 * chip state are copied into the paused state, which the main console then loads. That is the only change to the
 * game: everything else, main RAM first, is the paused state's, byte for byte, and [apply] checks it.
 *
 * Every guard failing gives a [ResyncRefusal]: the game then resumes from its paused state exactly as without music
 * during pauses (the music jumps back).

     * shore of Route 13, a waterfall, a fountain...): a looping sound effect started when the player steps on the area
     * and stopped (`StopSE`) when they leave it, playing as long as they stand there, so it never ends during a pause.

     * within a frame, and the NNS player frees their handles), instead of after the rest of their length. HeartGold
     * only ever waits for such a sound to end (battle text `{WAIT_SE}`, the opponent's send-out waiting for its cry,
     * script `WaitSE` / `WaitCry` / `WaitFanfare`): it may then go on a little sooner, with the same outcome (measured
     * on battle intros: the command menu still comes at the same frame). Fanfares stay refused, as they pause the
     * music: the field or battle music, paused at the end, plays no sound then. A pause from the fanfare's start to
     * 15 frames after its end (an item found: ~2 s) is refused too ([ResyncRefusal.SongChanged]): the game itself
